# Upstream cookbooks
#
# These are all the top-level cookbooks used by isolated chef servers
# in BACH clusters.  The bach_cluster deployment cookbook maintains
# these references so we may upload them to the chef server created
# by the cookbook.
# 
# This list was derived from known roles and runlists.
